# Hop-Quest
This is a simple 2D game developed using Python and Pygame. It focus on core mechanics like jumping, collisions, movement done no use of sprites or external assets . Just purely based on logic and shapes. I built this project to understand how loops and real time updates happen in python. Every element is coded manually to get hands-on experience.
